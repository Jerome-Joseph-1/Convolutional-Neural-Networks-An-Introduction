VGG19 is part of the VGG (Visual Geometry Group) series of models known for their deep architectures and simplicity. The "19" in VGG19 refers to the number of layers with weights.

#### Layer Composition of VGG19
1. **Convolutional Layers**: VGG19 consists of 16 convolutional layers. These layers are the backbone of the model, responsible for feature extraction from the input images. In VGG19, these layers use small (3x3) filters, which allows the network to capture fine details from the images.

2. **Fully Connected Layers**: There are 3 fully connected layers in VGG19 ( you can find them at the end in the above figure ). After the convolutional layers have extracted features, these layers are responsible for processing and making the final classification decision based on these features.

3. **Pooling Layers**: VGG19 includes max pooling layers placed at intervals between certain convolutional layers. While not part of the count of 19 layers, they play a crucial role in reducing the spatial size of the representation, thereby reducing the number of parameters and computation in the network.

4. **Activation Functions**: After each convolutional layer, VGG19 employs the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function. These functions introduce non-linearity to the network, allowing it to learn more complex patterns in the data.

#### Special Characteristics

- **Uniform Architecture**: One of the defining characteristics of VGG19 is its uniform architecture. Each convolutional layer uses the same size filters (3x3) and the same stride and padding. This uniformity simplifies the architecture and makes it easier to scale.

- **Depth**: The depth of VGG19, with its 19 layers, allows it to learn a hierarchy of features, from simple to complex, making it very effective for tasks like image classification.
